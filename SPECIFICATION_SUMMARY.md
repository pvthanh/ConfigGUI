## 🎯 Feature Summary

### Application Purpose

ConfigGUI is a **schema-driven configuration editor** that:

✅ Loads JSON Schema files  
✅ Auto-generates dynamic GUI forms  
✅ Pre-populates forms from existing configs  
✅ Validates in real-time against schema constraints  
✅ Generates valid JSON output files  
✅ Supports multiple schemas  

### MVP Scope (4 P1 User Stories)

| # | User Story | Priority |
|---|-----------|----------|
| 1 | Load JSON Schema & Auto-Generate Form | P1 |
| 2 | Pre-Fill from Existing Configuration | P1 |
| 3 | Real-Time Validation | P1 |
| 4 | Generate Valid Configuration File | P1 |

### Enhancement Features (2 P2 User Stories)

| # | User Story | Priority |
|---|-----------|----------|
| 5 | Support Multiple Schemas | P2 |
| 6 | Display Field Metadata & Constraints | P2 |

## ⚠️ Clarifications Needed

Before proceeding to planning, please provide answers to 3 scope clarification questions:

### Question 1: JSON Schema Draft Support
**Recommended**: Support JSON Schema Draft 7 only (simplest, most compatible)

**Your choice**: Q1: A / B / C

### Question 2: Schema References ($ref imports)
**Recommended**: Standalone schemas only in v1.0 (add $ref support in future)

**Your choice**: Q2: A / B / C

### Question 3: File Format Support
**Recommended**: JSON only in v1.0 (add YAML/TOML in future)

**Your choice**: Q3: A / B / C

See `CLARIFICATIONS.md` for detailed options and implications.

## 🚀 Next Steps

### To Finalize Specification

1. Open: `specs/001-schema-driven-config-gui/CLARIFICATIONS.md`
2. Review the 3 clarification questions
3. Provide your choices in format:
   ```
   Q1: A
   Q2: A
   Q3: A
   ```

### To Begin Planning

Once clarifications are provided, run:

```bash
/speckit.plan
```

This will generate:
- ✅ Detailed architecture and design
- ✅ Component breakdown and responsibilities
- ✅ Technology stack recommendations
- ✅ Timeline and effort estimation
- ✅ Testing strategy
- ✅ Implementation roadmap

## 🎓 Understanding the Specification

### For Business Stakeholders

Read `README.md` for executive summary and success metrics

### For Development Team

Read `spec.md` for detailed requirements and acceptance criteria

### For QA/Testing

Use acceptance scenarios in `spec.md` and edge cases to plan test cases

### For Architecture Team

Review user stories and requirements to understand workflow and data flows

## 💡 Key Principles from Constitution

This specification aligns with your project constitution:

✅ **Schema-Driven**: UI entirely generated from JSON Schema  
✅ **Real-Time Validation**: Immediate feedback to users  
✅ **Type-Safe**: Designed for MISRA C++ implementation  
✅ **Multi-Schema Support**: Extensible for diverse configuration types  
✅ **User-Focused**: Each requirement delivers measurable user value

## Questions or Revisions?

The specification is comprehensive and ready for review. You can:

- **Edit directly**: Make any changes to `spec.md` before committing
- **Request clarifications**: Use the CLARIFICATIONS.md questions
- **Suggest refinements**: Update requirements, success criteria, or edge cases

Once satisfied, provide clarification answers and proceed to `/speckit.plan`.
