# 🎉 Specification Complete - All Clarifications Resolved!

## Summary

Your ConfigGUI specification has been finalized with all clarifications resolved. The specification is now complete, verified, and ready for the planning phase.

---

## ✅ Clarifications Resolved

### Decision 1: JSON Schema Draft Support
**→ JSON Schema Draft 7**
- Industry-standard for configuration validation
- Excellent library ecosystem support (nlohmann/json-schema, etc.)
- Covers all common use cases
- Future upgrade path to newer drafts

### Decision 2: Schema References Support
**→ No Support in v1.0 (Standalone Schemas Only)**
- Simplifies MVP scope and accelerates delivery
- Eliminates external file resolution complexity
- Most real-world schemas are self-contained anyway
- Clean upgrade path: Add $ref support in v1.1 if needed

### Decision 3: File Format Support
**→ JSON and YAML Both Supported**
- Flexibility for different team preferences
- YAML for human readability, JSON for interchange
- Users choose format when loading configs
- Users choose output format when saving
- Internally uses common validation pipeline

### Edge Cases: All Resolved

✅ Invalid schema JSON → Error message shown  
✅ Incompatible config files → User notified with options  
✅ Unsaved changes on close → Save/discard prompt  
✅ Large schemas → Responsive performance maintained  
✅ Schema with references → Error: "Not supported in v1.0"  
✅ Format selection → User chooses JSON or YAML output  

### Constraints Updated

✅ Only JSON and YAML formats supported (not TOML in v1.0)  
✅ No schema references ($ref) in v1.0  
✅ Only JSON Schema Draft 7 initially  
✅ Standalone schemas only (no cross-schema imports)

## 🚀 Ready for Next Phase

**Current Status**: ✅ **SPECIFICATION COMPLETE & VERIFIED**

Your specification is ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` for:

- ✅ Detailed architecture and design specifications
- ✅ Component breakdown and responsibilities  
- ✅ Technology stack recommendations (Qt 6+, nlohmann/json-schema, libyaml)
- ✅ Development timeline and effort estimation
- ✅ Testing strategy and test coverage planning
- ✅ Implementation roadmap and phasing

---

## 🔑 Key Decisions & Impact

### JSON Schema Draft 7
- **Libraries**: nlohmann/json-schema, rapidjson
- **Validation**: Full Draft 7 compliance
- **Future**: Clear path to Draft 2020-12 in v1.1

### Standalone Schemas Only (v1.0)
- **Scope**: Simplified for MVP
- **Complexity**: Reduced validator requirements
- **Error Handling**: Clear error message if $ref found
- **v1.1 Feature**: Support for local file references

### JSON + YAML Support
- **Input**: Load either format (auto-detected from extension)
- **Output**: User selects format in Save dialog
- **Validation**: Common pipeline for both formats
- **Implementation**: YAML parser + JSON Schema validator
