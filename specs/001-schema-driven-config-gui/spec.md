# Feature Specification: Schema-Driven Configuration GUI

**Feature Branch**: `001-schema-driven-config-gui`  
**Created**: 2025-10-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Schema-driven GUI for JSON configuration files with auto-generation, field pre-filling from existing configs, validation support, and output generation"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Load JSON Schema and Auto-Generate Configuration Form (Priority: P1)

A user wants to configure an application by loading a JSON Schema file. The system analyzes the schema structure and automatically generates an interactive form with appropriate input widgets for each field defined in the schema. This is the foundational capability that enables all other features.

**Why this priority**: This is the core MVP. Without schema loading and form generation, the application cannot function. Every other feature depends on this capability.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading any valid JSON Schema file and verifying that: (1) form fields are generated, (2) field types match schema definitions, (3) constraints (required/optional) are enforced in UI.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid JSON Schema file is available, **When** user selects "Load Schema" and chooses the schema file, **Then** the application displays a form with all schema-defined fields rendered as appropriate input controls (text fields, dropdowns, checkboxes, number spinners, etc.)
2. **Given** a schema with nested objects, **When** the schema is loaded, **Then** the form displays nested sections or expandable groups corresponding to object structure
3. **Given** a schema with required and optional fields, **When** the form is generated, **Then** required fields are visually marked (e.g., asterisk or color) and optional fields are clearly distinguishable
4. **Given** a schema with field constraints (e.g., min/max, enum values, pattern), **When** the form is generated, **Then** these constraints are reflected in widget configuration (e.g., spinners have min/max, dropdowns show enum options)

---

### User Story 2 - Pre-Fill Form from Existing Configuration File (Priority: P1)

A user has a previous configuration file that matches the current schema. They want to load this existing configuration to pre-populate the form fields, reducing manual data entry and allowing them to make incremental changes rather than starting from scratch.

**Why this priority**: This is essential for usability. Most configuration management workflows involve updating existing configs, not creating entirely new ones. Pre-filling dramatically improves user experience and adoption.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading a schema, then loading an existing JSON config file that matches that schema, and verifying that all form fields are populated with values from the config file without user interaction.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a form has been generated from a schema, **When** user selects "Load Existing Configuration" and chooses a previous config file, **Then** all form fields are populated with values from that config file
2. **Given** the existing config contains values for optional fields, **When** the form is populated, **Then** optional fields that have values in the config are shown and populated
3. **Given** the existing config is missing values for some optional fields, **When** the form is populated, **Then** those optional fields remain empty/unset
4. **Given** the existing config contains a value that violates current schema constraints, **When** the form loads, **Then** user is notified of the validation issue and the field is marked as invalid

---

### User Story 3 - Real-Time Validation Against JSON Schema (Priority: P1)

As a user edits configuration values in the form, the system continuously validates each field against the JSON Schema constraints. Validation errors are displayed immediately, preventing the user from generating invalid configurations.

**Why this priority**: Validation is a core requirement to ensure only valid configurations are saved. Real-time validation provides immediate feedback and prevents invalid states early, improving user experience and data quality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering invalid values (wrong type, out of range, pattern mismatch) into form fields and verifying that validation errors appear immediately without requiring a "Save" or "Validate" button click.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a form field requires a number within range 1-100, **When** user enters 150, **Then** validation error appears immediately indicating the value exceeds maximum
2. **Given** a form field has a regex pattern constraint, **When** user enters text that doesn't match the pattern, **Then** validation error appears with message explaining the expected format
3. **Given** a form field is required, **When** user clears or leaves the field empty, **Then** validation error appears indicating the field is required
4. **Given** a form field has an enum constraint, **When** user enters a value not in the enum list, **Then** validation error appears showing allowed values
5. **Given** a form has multiple validation errors, **When** user attempts to generate output, **Then** save is blocked and all errors are highlighted

---

### User Story 4 - Generate Valid Configuration File (Priority: P1)

Once the user has filled and validated all required configuration fields, they can generate the final configuration file. The system outputs a properly formatted JSON file containing only the configured values, ready for deployment.

**Why this priority**: This is the final step that delivers value to the user. Without output generation, the entire workflow is incomplete. This completes the MVP.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by fully populating a form, ensuring all validations pass, clicking "Generate" or "Save", and verifying that a valid JSON file is created with correct structure and values.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** all required form fields are populated and validated, **When** user clicks "Generate Configuration", **Then** a JSON file is created with all form values in correct schema structure
2. **Given** optional fields that were left empty, **When** configuration is generated, **Then** empty optional fields are either omitted from JSON or included with null values (depending on schema requirements)
3. **Given** a generated configuration file, **When** the file is validated against the original schema, **Then** validation passes successfully
4. **Given** user generates a configuration, **When** the file is created, **Then** user is prompted to choose save location and file name, or file is auto-saved with default naming convention

---

### User Story 5 - Support Multiple Schemas (Priority: P2)

The application can manage configurations for multiple different schema types. Users can switch between different schemas and work with configurations for each independently. This enables the tool to serve as a general-purpose configuration editor for diverse systems.

**Why this priority**: P2 because MVP works with single schema, but this feature significantly expands tool applicability. Required for production use in complex environments with multiple config types.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading two different JSON schema files with different structures, switching between them, populating both, and verifying each maintains its own form state and generates correct output.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is running, **When** user loads Schema A then loads Schema B, **Then** form updates to reflect Schema B structure while Schema A is preserved for later switching
2. **Given** user has configured form for Schema A with partial data, **When** user switches to Schema B and back to Schema A, **Then** the previously entered data for Schema A is preserved
3. **Given** multiple schemas are loaded, **When** user switches between schemas, **Then** form, validation state, and any loaded config file are all properly context-switched

---

### User Story 6 - Display Field Metadata and Validation Rules (Priority: P2)

Configuration fields often have descriptions, examples, and validation constraints that help users understand what values are appropriate. The application displays this metadata in tooltips, help text, or sidebars to guide user input.

**Why this priority**: P2 improves user experience and reduces errors. Many users will successfully configure without this, but it significantly improves quality and reduces support burden.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading a schema with description, examples, and constraints, and verifying that this information is accessible to users (via tooltips, help panels, or field descriptions).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a schema field includes a description property, **When** the form is displayed, **Then** field description is shown in tooltip or help text
2. **Given** a schema field includes examples, **When** user hovers over or focuses the field, **Then** example values are displayed to guide input
3. **Given** a schema field has validation constraints (min, max, pattern, enum), **When** field is focused or tooltip is shown, **Then** constraints are displayed in user-friendly format (e.g., "Must be between 1 and 100", "Must match format: xxx-xxx-xxxx")

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user loads a schema that is invalid JSON or doesn't conform to JSON Schema specification? → Error message displayed, user returned to schema selection
- How does system handle loading a configuration file that is incompatible with the currently loaded schema? → User is notified of incompatibility, offered to view differences, and can choose to load anyway (with validation errors highlighted) or cancel
- What happens if user closes the application without saving changes to a configuration? → User is prompted to save/discard unsaved changes
- How does system handle extremely large configuration files or deeply nested schemas? → System loads and renders without hanging, with reasonable performance expectations
- What if schema references external files or has dependencies? → Schema references are not supported in v1.0; only standalone, self-contained schemas are supported. This simplifies implementation and scope for initial release. Schema reference support can be added in v1.1 if needed.
- What file formats are supported beyond JSON? → JSON and YAML are both supported for configuration files. This provides flexibility for teams that prefer YAML while maintaining JSON compatibility.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST load and parse JSON Schema files from user-selected file paths
- **FR-002**: System MUST dynamically generate GUI form components from schema field definitions, mapping schema types to appropriate UI widgets (text input, number spinner, dropdown/select, checkbox, date picker, etc.)
- **FR-003**: System MUST support nested object structures in schema and render them as nested form sections or expandable groups
- **FR-004**: System MUST support schema constraints and render them in UI (required/optional fields visually distinguished, field constraints reflected in widget configuration)
- **FR-005**: System MUST load existing JSON configuration files and pre-populate form fields with matching values from the config
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate form input in real-time against schema constraints (type checking, range validation, pattern matching, enum validation, required field validation)
- **FR-007**: System MUST display validation errors immediately when constraints are violated, and prevent configuration output generation when validation errors exist
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to generate a JSON configuration file from completed and validated form data
- **FR-009**: System MUST support loading and switching between multiple different JSON Schema files within the same application session
- **FR-010**: System MUST preserve form data and state when switching between schemas
- **FR-011**: System MUST display schema field metadata (descriptions, examples, constraints) to users via tooltips, help text, or field descriptions
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle schema incompatibility gracefully when loading configs (detect mismatches and notify user)
- **FR-013**: System MUST prompt user to save unsaved changes before closing or switching schemas
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle validation errors in loaded config files and highlight invalid fields in the form
- **FR-015**: System MUST support loading configuration files in both JSON and YAML formats
- **FR-016**: System MUST allow users to select output format (JSON or YAML) when generating configuration files

### Key Entities

- **JSONSchema**: Represents the structure definition for configuration data. Contains type definitions, constraints (required, minimum, maximum, pattern, enum), descriptions, examples, and nested object/array definitions. The system supports JSON Schema draft 7 for v1.0.
- **ConfigurationData**: Represents user-provided configuration values. Maps field names to values. Can be in partial state (incomplete) or complete state (all required fields populated). Can be valid or invalid based on schema validation.
- **ValidationError**: Represents a validation rule violation. Contains error message, field path, error type (type mismatch, out of range, pattern mismatch, etc.), and suggested correction if applicable.
- **FormState**: Represents current UI form state including which fields are visible, what values are entered, which fields have focus, and current validation status of each field.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can generate a valid configuration file from a schema-loaded form within 5 minutes of first loading the schema (assuming typical 10-20 field configuration)
- **SC-002**: 100% of generated configuration files pass validation against their source JSON Schema with zero validation errors
- **SC-003**: System can load and render schemas with up to 100 fields without performance degradation (form appears responsive within 2 seconds)
- **SC-004**: 95% of configuration fields are correctly pre-populated when loading an existing config file that matches the schema
- **SC-005**: Users report that real-time validation errors are helpful and guide them toward correct input values (measured via post-task survey: 80% agreement or higher)
- **SC-006**: System successfully switches between and manages 5+ different schema types in a single session without data loss or state corruption
- **SC-007**: All validation rules from JSON Schema are properly enforced in UI (required fields, type constraints, range constraints, enum constraints, pattern constraints - 100% coverage)
- **SC-008**: Field metadata (descriptions and constraints) are displayed to 100% of applicable fields

## Assumptions

- JSON Schema input files will be valid according to JSON Schema specification (malformed schemas will show error to user)
- Configuration files being loaded will be valid JSON format (though may not match current schema)
- User has read access to schema and config files they are loading
- Application runs on systems with modern GUI support (Windows 10+, macOS 10.14+, Linux with X11/Wayland)
- Typical configurations will not exceed 1000 fields or 10 levels of nesting
- JSON Schema versions will be limited to common versions (draft 7 or later) - no legacy draft 3/4 support required initially

## Constraints & Limitations

- File operations are local only (no cloud/remote file access in initial release)
- No user authentication or multi-user collaboration in initial release
- Generated config files support JSON and YAML formats (user selects format at save time)
- No automatic schema inference from existing config files (schema must be explicitly provided)
- Schema references ($ref) not supported in v1.0; only standalone schemas. Reference support planned for v1.1
- Schema updates by user require reloading schema file (no dynamic schema hot-reloading)
