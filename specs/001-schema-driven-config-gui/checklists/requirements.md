- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

### Clarifications Resolved ✅

All three [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers have been resolved:

1. **JSON Schema Draft Support**: Resolved to **JSON Schema Draft 7**
   - Provides best balance of feature completeness and library ecosystem support
   - Covers 99% of real-world configuration scenarios
   - Can be extended to newer drafts in future releases

2. **Schema References/Imports**: Resolved to **No support in v1.0**
   - Only standalone, self-contained schemas supported initially
   - Simplifies implementation and reduces scope
   - Reference support ($ref) planned for v1.1 if needed

3. **File Format Support**: Resolved to **JSON and YAML**
   - Both formats supported for configuration file input/output
   - Users can load YAML or JSON configs interchangeably
   - Users can choose output format (JSON or YAML) when saving
   - Provides flexibility for teams with format preferences

### Specification Status

✅ **READY FOR PLANNING** - All clarifications resolved, all requirements testable and unambiguous, no outstanding issues.

The specification is complete and ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` for detailed architecture and implementation planning.
