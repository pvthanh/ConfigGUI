# ✅ Clarifications Resolved - Specification Ready for Planning

## Summary of Changes

All clarification markers have been resolved in the specification. Here are the decisions made:

---

## Clarification Decisions

### 1. ✅ JSON Schema Draft Support → **Draft 7**

**Why Draft 7?**
- Most widely supported in validator libraries
- Stable and feature-complete for typical configurations
- Best library ecosystem support
- Clear upgrade path to newer drafts in future

**Implementation**: Use JSON Schema Draft 7 validator; plan v1.1 for newer drafts if needed

---

### 2. ✅ Schema References → **No Support in v1.0**

**Why No References?**
- Simplifies MVP scope and accelerates delivery
- Eliminates complexity of external resolution
- Most schemas used are standalone/application-specific
- Cleaner upgrade path in v1.1

**Scope**: Only standalone, self-contained schemas in v1.0  
**Future**: v1.1 can add $ref support for local files

---

### 3. ✅ File Format Support → **JSON + YAML**

**Why Both?**
- YAML is industry standard alongside JSON
- Teams prefer YAML for readability
- Maximizes tool applicability
- Easy to support both (convert to common internal format)

**Features Added**:
- FR-015: Load both JSON and YAML config files
- FR-016: User selects output format (JSON or YAML) at save time

---

## Updated Specification

2. **checklists/requirements.md**
   - ✅ Marked all checklist items as COMPLETE
   - ✅ Updated Notes section with resolution details
   - ✅ Marked as READY FOR PLANNING

3. **CLARIFICATIONS.md**
   - ✅ Converted to clarification resolution document
   - ✅ Documents all decisions and rationale
   - ✅ Implementation notes for each decision
   - ✅ Future roadmap for v1.1+

## New Functional Requirements (YAML Support)

- **FR-015**: System MUST support loading configuration files in both JSON and YAML formats
  - Auto-detect format from file extension (.json, .yaml, .yml)
  - Or explicit user selection for ambiguous files
  - Support nested structures and schema validation for YAML

- **FR-016**: System MUST allow users to select output format (JSON or YAML) when generating configuration files
  - Save dialog includes format selector
  - Maintains user's format preference in recent files
  - Ensures generated config matches schema regardless of format

## Ready for Planning! 🚀

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE AND VERIFIED**

All specification quality criteria have been met:
- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
- ✅ All requirements testable
- ✅ All success criteria measurable
- ✅ No implementation details
- ✅ All edge cases identified
- ✅ Scope clearly bounded

**Next Step**: You are ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` to generate:
- Detailed architecture and design
- Component breakdown and responsibilities
- Technology stack recommendations
- Timeline and effort estimation
- Testing strategy
- Implementation roadmap

---

## Key Decisions Impact

### For Development
- **JSON Schema Draft 7**: Use `nlohmann/json-schema` or similar validated library
- **YAML Support**: Integrate YAML parser (libyaml) into build system
- **No $ref**: Simplifies validator logic; add in v1.1 if needed

### For Testing
- **16 FR Test Cases**: Verify both JSON and YAML load/save cycles
- **6 Edge Cases**: Schema validation errors, format mismatches, etc.
- **User Acceptance**: YAML format flexibility tested with team preferences

### For Scope
- **v1.0 Focused**: Core MVP with JSON + YAML support, no schema references
- **v1.1 Ready**: Schema $ref support, additional format options planned
- **Maintainability**: Clean separation between format handling and validation
