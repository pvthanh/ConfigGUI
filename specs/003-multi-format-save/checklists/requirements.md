# Specification Quality Checklist: Multi-Format Configuration Save

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 27, 2025
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All items passed initial validation. Specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

### Summary

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

- 5 user stories defined with clear priority levels (P1, P2)
- 12 functional requirements with technology-agnostic language
- 6 edge cases identified and addressed
- 8 measurable success criteria with quantifiable metrics
- 7 explicit assumptions documented
- Full acceptance scenarios for all user stories
- Round-trip testability ensured (can save and load in both formats)

### Key Strengths

1. **Feature Parity**: Both Qt and HTML GUIs are equally represented (User Stories 3 & 4)
2. **Data Integrity Focus**: User Story 5 (P2) ensures quality verification
3. **Clear Scope**: Two formats (JSON, INI) with distinct use cases
4. **Measurable Success**: Metrics include data preservation, performance, and reliability
5. **Error Handling**: Edge cases cover filesystem, permissions, and data compatibility issues
6. **Testability**: Each user story can be independently tested and verified

### Validation Details

#### Content Quality ✅
- Specification focuses on user needs (save configurations in different formats)
- No references to specific libraries (e.g., nlohmann_json, YAML libraries)
- No references to implementation details (no C++17, Qt signals/slots, JavaScript frameworks)
- Written for stakeholders who need to understand feature capability, not developers

#### Requirement Completeness ✅
- All 12 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-012) are testable
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- Success criteria (SC-001 through SC-008) are measurable and specific:
  - SC-001: "100% data preservation in round-trip test"
  - SC-003: "500ms dialog response time"
  - SC-004: "1 minute total save operation"
  - SC-005: "99.9% success rate"

#### User Scenarios ✅
- 5 user stories cover core functionality and edge cases
- Each story has 2-4 acceptance scenarios using Given-When-Then format
- Independent testability ensured (can test JSON separately from INI, Qt separately from HTML)
- Priority levels (P1, P2) guide implementation sequencing

#### Edge Cases ✅
- 6 edge cases identified: no filename, read-only directory, special characters, cancellation, failures, large data
- Each edge case has defined expected behavior

#### Assumptions ✅
- 7 assumptions explicitly stated
- No blockers; all assumptions are reasonable for the codebase context
- Deferred documentation updates align with user requirement ("after manual testing")

### Minor Observations

1. **INI Format Mapping**: User Story 2 assumes standard INI format conventions (sections, key=value) which will be clarified during planning
2. **Data Type Conversion**: Assumption #2 addresses mapping of complex types to INI, suitable for clarification in planning phase
3. **Format Validation**: Implicit that both formats must validate according to schema after save/load

These observations are normal for specification phase and are expected to be resolved during planning.
