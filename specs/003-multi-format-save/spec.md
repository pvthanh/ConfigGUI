# Feature Specification: Multi-Format Configuration Save

**Feature Branch**: `003-multi-format-save`  
**Created**: October 27, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "A new feature will be added to support saving configuration data in either .json or .ini format. When the user clicks the Save button, they will be prompted to choose the desired file format. Based on the selected format, the application will store the configuration accordingly. This functionality will be implemented for both the HTML GUI and the Qt GUI. Documentation updates are not required during development and testing. The documentation will be updated only after manual testing is completed and the results are confirmed to be ready for delivery."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Save Configuration in JSON Format (Priority: P1)

User needs to save their current configuration settings in JSON format, which is the standard, human-readable format supported by the ConfigGUI schema validator and widely used for configuration management.

**Why this priority**: P1 is critical because JSON is the primary format already supported by the application's validation layer and existing schema system. Enabling JSON save preserves the existing validation capabilities and maintains compatibility with the schema-driven configuration approach.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by: loading an existing configuration in the application, clicking Save, selecting JSON format from the dialog, confirming the file is saved with .json extension, and verifying the saved content is valid JSON that matches the original configuration.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has loaded a valid configuration in the application, **When** they click the Save button, **Then** a format selection dialog appears with JSON as an option.
2. **Given** a format selection dialog is open, **When** the user selects JSON format, **Then** a file save dialog appears with .json extension pre-populated.
3. **Given** a user has selected JSON format and chosen a file path, **When** they confirm the save, **Then** the configuration is written to the file in valid JSON format.
4. **Given** a configuration has been saved as JSON, **When** the user reopens the application and loads that file, **Then** the configuration data is correctly restored.

### User Story 2 - Save Configuration in INI Format (Priority: P1)

User needs to save their configuration settings in INI format, enabling compatibility with legacy systems and applications that use .ini files (common in Windows and enterprise environments).

**Why this priority**: P1 because INI format support directly addresses the stated requirement and provides an alternative storage format to JSON. This is equally important as JSON support to fulfill the core feature specification.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by: loading a valid configuration, clicking Save, selecting INI format from the dialog, confirming the file is saved with .ini extension, and verifying the saved content is valid INI format with appropriate sections and key-value pairs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has loaded a valid configuration in the application, **When** they click the Save button, **Then** a format selection dialog appears with INI as an option.
2. **Given** a format selection dialog is open, **When** the user selects INI format, **Then** a file save dialog appears with .ini extension pre-populated.
3. **Given** a user has selected INI format and chosen a file path, **When** they confirm the save, **Then** the configuration is written to the file in valid INI format with [sections] and key=value pairs.
4. **Given** a configuration has been saved as INI, **When** the user or another application reads that file, **Then** the configuration data is correctly parsed.

### User Story 3 - Format Selection Dialog in Qt GUI (Priority: P1)

User interface in the Qt desktop application should present a clear, intuitive dialog allowing the user to choose between JSON and INI formats before saving.

**Why this priority**: P1 because the Qt GUI is one of the two required target implementations. The dialog directly enables both JSON and INI save functionality for desktop users.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by: launching the Qt GUI application, loading a configuration, clicking Save, verifying a dialog with format options appears, selecting each format option, and confirming the appropriate save dialog follows.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the Qt GUI application is running with a loaded configuration, **When** the user clicks the Save button, **Then** a modal dialog appears with JSON and INI format options.
2. **Given** the format selection dialog is displayed, **When** the user selects one format and clicks OK, **Then** the application proceeds to the file save dialog with the appropriate file extension.
3. **Given** the format selection dialog is displayed, **When** the user clicks Cancel, **Then** the save operation is aborted and no file is created.

---

### User Story 4 - Format Selection Dialog in HTML GUI (Priority: P1)

User interface in the HTML web application should present a clear, intuitive method (dialog, dropdown, or other UI element) allowing the user to choose between JSON and INI formats before saving.

**Why this priority**: P1 because the HTML GUI is the second of two required target implementations. This ensures feature parity across both interfaces.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by: accessing the HTML GUI in a web browser, loading a configuration, clicking Save, verifying a UI element with format options appears, selecting each format, and confirming the appropriate download or save behavior follows.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the HTML GUI is accessed in a web browser with a loaded configuration, **When** the user clicks the Save button, **Then** a dialog or UI element appears with JSON and INI format options.
2. **Given** the format selection UI is displayed, **When** the user selects one format and confirms, **Then** the file is saved/downloaded with the appropriate format and file extension.
3. **Given** the format selection UI is displayed, **When** the user clicks Cancel or closes the dialog, **Then** the save operation is aborted.

### User Story 5 - Preserve Configuration Data Integrity During Format Conversion (Priority: P2)

When converting between formats (JSON to INI or INI to JSON), configuration data must be accurately preserved without loss or corruption, respecting the constraints of each format.

**Why this priority**: P2 because while important for data consistency, this is a quality/verification concern that becomes apparent during testing and refinement. The primary user stories (P1) address the core feature.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by: creating a comprehensive configuration with various data types, saving in JSON format, then loading that file and saving in INI format, loading the INI file in a different system or validator, and verifying data integrity.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a configuration with complex nested values is saved as JSON, **When** that JSON is read and re-saved as INI, **Then** all data is preserved or appropriately flattened according to INI format constraints.
2. **Given** a configuration saved as INI, **When** loaded and verified against the schema, **Then** all values conform to their expected types.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user clicks Save but provides no filename? → Save operation should be cancelled or use a default filename pattern.
- What happens when a user attempts to save to a read-only directory? → System should display an error message and prevent the save operation.
- What happens when configuration contains special characters or unicode that may not be compatible with INI format? → System should either sanitize the data, display a warning, or provide guidance on data limitation.
- What happens when a user cancels the format selection dialog? → Save operation should be cleanly aborted with no side effects.
- What happens if the save operation fails (disk full, permission denied, etc.)? → User should receive a clear error message indicating the reason for failure.
- What happens when configuration data is too large for a single INI file? → System should handle gracefully (either reject, warn, or split appropriately).

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display a format selection dialog when the user clicks the Save button, presenting JSON and INI as options.
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate that a format has been selected before proceeding with the save operation.
- **FR-003**: System MUST serialize configuration data to JSON format when JSON is selected, producing valid JSON that adheres to the JSON specification.
- **FR-004**: System MUST serialize configuration data to INI format when INI is selected, producing valid INI file format with [sections] and key=value pairs.
- **FR-005**: System MUST open a file save dialog after format selection, with the appropriate file extension (.json or .ini) pre-populated in the filename.
- **FR-006**: System MUST support saving files to any user-accessible location on the filesystem.
- **FR-007**: System MUST preserve all configuration data during serialization, maintaining data types and structure as much as possible within format constraints.
- **FR-008**: The format selection dialog MUST be implemented in the Qt GUI application with appropriate visual design consistency.
- **FR-009**: The format selection dialog MUST be implemented in the HTML GUI application with appropriate visual design consistency.
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle save failures gracefully, displaying an error message to the user and allowing retry or cancellation.
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow users to cancel the save operation at the format selection stage without side effects.
- **FR-012**: System MUST support both absolute and relative file paths for save operations.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Configuration Data**: The structured configuration object containing user settings, parameters, and preferences that will be serialized to the selected format.
- **Format Specification**: Either JSON (RFC 7159) or INI (Windows INI file format with [sections] and key=value pairs).
- **File Path**: The filesystem location where the configuration will be persisted.
- **Serialization Result**: The output data in the chosen format, either success with saved file or error with diagnostic information.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can save configuration in JSON format and successfully reload it, with 100% data preservation in a round-trip test.
- **SC-002**: Users can save configuration in INI format and the file is valid and readable by standard INI parsers, with all configuration keys and values correctly mapped.
- **SC-003**: The format selection dialog appears within 500ms of clicking the Save button in both Qt and HTML GUIs.
- **SC-004**: Users can complete a save operation (including format selection and file confirmation) within 1 minute for configurations of typical size (< 1MB).
- **SC-005**: Save operations with either format succeed 99.9% of the time under normal filesystem conditions (adequate disk space, write permissions).
- **SC-006**: Both Qt GUI and HTML GUI implementations support the full feature set with format parity (both can save JSON and INI).
- **SC-007**: Configuration data integrity is maintained across all supported data types and structures when converting between formats.
- **SC-008**: Users can cancel the save operation at any point before file confirmation, with no partial files or side effects remaining.

## Assumptions

1. **Existing Schema Validation**: The application already has a working schema validation system that can validate JSON configurations. INI serialization should map configuration data to INI format while maintaining validity.

2. **Data Type Representation**: Configuration data types (strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects) will be mapped to INI format using standard conventions (e.g., arrays as comma-separated values in INI, nested objects flattened with dot-notation keys).

3. **File Extensions**: Files will use .json for JSON format and .ini for INI format based on user selection.

4. **Filesystem Access**: The application has appropriate permissions to write files to user-selected directories.

5. **No Backup Strategy Required**: The specification does not include automatic backup of existing files with the same name before overwrite; this is a potential enhancement for future phases.

6. **Format Completeness**: Both JSON and INI implementations will support the full range of configuration data the application currently handles.

7. **Testing Approach**: Documentation updates are deferred until after manual testing and validation are complete, as specified in the user requirements.

## Technical Notes

- Both Qt (C++ with Qt framework) and HTML (JavaScript/ES6) implementations will need serialization logic for each format.
- The core library should provide format-agnostic serialization interfaces that both UI implementations can consume.
- INI format handling should use a library or standard approach to ensure compatibility with common INI parsers.
- Configuration data should be validated after round-trip serialization and deserialization to ensure integrity.
