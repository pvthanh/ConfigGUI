# Feature Specification: HTML Form Generation with Local Server

**Feature Branch**: `002-html-form-generation`  
**Created**: October 24, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Enable automatic HTML form generation from JSON or YAML schemas with local server hosting"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Developer Deploys HTML Application Without Qt (Priority: P1)

A developer in an environment without Qt dependencies (e.g., embedded systems, lightweight servers, Docker containers) wants to use ConfigGUI to manage configurations via a web interface instead of installing Qt libraries.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary value proposition of the feature - enabling ConfigGUI to work in non-Qt environments. Without this, the HTML generation has limited utility.

**Independent Test**: Deploy the HTML application in a Qt-free environment, start the local server, access the main form in a browser, and verify all functionality works without requiring Qt libraries or binaries.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a system without Qt libraries installed, **When** the HTML application is started, **Then** the application launches successfully and listens on localhost
2. **Given** a running HTML application, **When** accessing it via web browser, **Then** the main form is displayed with schema selection functionality
3. **Given** the running HTML application, **When** requesting a schema-based form through HTTP, **Then** the form is generated and displayed correctly

---

### User Story 2 - End User Generates Configuration GUI from Schema Selection (Priority: P1)

An end user accesses the HTML application's main form, selects a JSON or YAML schema file, and sees a dynamically generated configuration form that mirrors the behavior of the Qt version.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality - the ability to generate forms from schemas in a browser. It's independently testable and delivers immediate value.

**Independent Test**: Start the HTML server, access the main form, select or upload a valid JSON schema, and verify the generated form displays all fields, validation rules, and behaviors identical to the Qt version.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the main form is loaded, **When** the user selects a schema from available options or uploads a schema file, **Then** the application validates the schema and displays confirmation
2. **Given** a valid schema has been selected, **When** the application processes it, **Then** the corresponding HTML form is generated and displayed
3. **Given** a generated form is displayed, **When** the user interacts with fields, **Then** validation rules are applied in real-time (showing errors/feedback identical to Qt version)
4. **Given** a user fills in the form, **When** they submit, **Then** the configuration is saved and validated according to schema rules

---

### User Story 3 - Qt Developer Maintains Single Codebase with Shared Core (Priority: P1)

A Qt developer working on ConfigGUI wants to add HTML form generation without duplicating validation logic, data handling, or utility functions. Qt-specific UI code remains isolated in Qt modules.

**Why this priority**: This ensures code maintainability and consistency. Without architectural separation, bugs fixed in one UI would need to be fixed in the other. This is critical for long-term project health.

**Independent Test**: Verify that validation logic, data transformation, and core utilities are called from both Qt and HTML code paths. Modify a validation rule in the shared core and confirm it affects both Qt and HTML outputs identically.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the codebase is structured with shared core, **When** a developer adds a new validation rule to the core, **Then** that rule is automatically available to both Qt and HTML applications without code duplication
2. **Given** a schema with complex validation rules, **When** the form is generated in both Qt and HTML, **Then** the validation behaves identically in both versions
3. **Given** a Qt module is modified (e.g., styling), **When** the HTML module is built, **Then** no compilation errors occur and HTML form generation remains unaffected

---

### User Story 4 - Configuration Manager Uses HTML for Configuration Generation and Export (Priority: P2)

A configuration manager uses the HTML interface to load schemas, fill out configuration forms, and export the resulting configuration as JSON or YAML files to be used by other systems.

**Why this priority**: This is a secondary use case that extends the primary functionality. It demonstrates the HTML interface as a complete configuration tool, not just a viewer.

**Independent Test**: Generate a configuration through the HTML form, modify fields, and export the result as both JSON and YAML formats. Verify the exported files are valid and match the user's input.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a completed configuration form, **When** the user clicks export, **Then** they are presented with format options (JSON/YAML)
2. **Given** the user selects an export format, **When** they confirm export, **Then** the file is downloaded with correct formatting and content

---

### User Story 5 - DevOps Containerizes HTML Application (Priority: P2)

A DevOps engineer creates a Docker container image of the HTML application for deployment across multiple environments without needing Qt dependencies.

**Why this priority**: This enables cloud/container deployment scenarios. Important for scalability but not required for MVP.

**Independent Test**: Build a Docker image of the HTML application, run a container, and verify the application starts and serves the schema selection form correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Dockerfile for the HTML application, **When** the image is built and container is run, **Then** the application starts and listens on the configured port
2. **Given** a running containerized application, **When** accessed via browser, **Then** all schema loading and form generation features work correctly

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user selects an invalid or malformed JSON/YAML schema file?
- How does the system handle very large schemas (thousands of properties or nested objects)?
- What happens when the user's browser loses connection during form submission?
- How does the system handle special characters or Unicode in schema field names and values?
- What happens when a user attempts to upload a schema file that exceeds size limits?
- How does the application handle concurrent users requesting different schemas or submitting configurations?
- What happens when the local server runs out of available ports or memory?
- How does validation behave when schema rules reference external data or dependencies?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a local web server that serves an HTML-based main form
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to select, upload, or browse available JSON or YAML schema files through the main form
- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically generate HTML forms from valid JSON or YAML schemas with identical field types, validation rules, and structure as the Qt version
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate form input against schema rules in real-time and display validation feedback identical to the Qt version
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to save/submit configuration data from generated forms
- **FR-006**: System MUST support exporting generated configurations as JSON or YAML files
- **FR-007**: System MUST share core validation, data handling, and utility functions between Qt and HTML implementations through a common C++ module
- **FR-008**: System MUST isolate Qt-specific UI code (widgets, dialogs, styling) in separate modules that don't interfere with HTML build or runtime
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide error messages and validation feedback in the HTML interface (matching Qt behavior for consistency)
- **FR-010**: System MUST support nested objects and arrays in schemas (matching Qt form generation capabilities)
- **FR-011**: System MUST support both creating new configurations from scratch and loading/editing existing configuration files
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle malformed schemas gracefully with clear error messages

### Key Entities

- **Schema**: A JSON or YAML document defining the structure, types, and validation rules for a configuration. Can contain nested objects, arrays, and validation rules (pattern, required, min/max, enum, etc.).
- **Configuration**: A user-filled instance of a schema-based form, containing user input values that conform to the schema's structure and validation rules.
- **ValidationRule**: A specification within a schema that defines constraints (required field, pattern matching, numeric ranges, enum values, etc.) applied during form filling and submission.
- **FormField**: A single input element in the generated HTML form corresponding to a property in the schema.
- **CoreModule**: Shared C++ library containing validation logic, configuration data structures, schema parsing, and utility functions used by both Qt and HTML interfaces.
- **QtModule**: Qt-specific code (widgets, dialogs, styling) isolated from the core and HTML implementations.
- **HtmlModule**: HTML/Web code (JavaScript, HTML templates, CSS) that uses the core module for backend logic.

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-009**: Users can select, load, and generate forms from schemas with upload times under 5 seconds for files up to 10MB
- **SC-010**: Documentation includes clear instructions for deploying HTML application independently of Qt

## Assumptions

- The existing Qt application's form generation logic can be refactored to extract schema-independent code into a shared core
- A web server (HTTP) is sufficient for the HTML interface (not requiring WebSockets or advanced real-time communication initially)
- End users have a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge from last 2 years)
- Network communication between browser and server is on localhost only (not requiring HTTPS initially)
- The local server will run on a standard port (e.g., 8080, 3000) configurable at startup
- Schema files are stored locally or uploaded by users (not requiring database integration initially)
- Configuration files are saved to local filesystem or downloaded by user (not requiring cloud storage initially)

## Dependencies & Constraints

- **Architectural**: Must maintain clean separation between Qt code and shared core to enable independent HTML deployment
- **Compatibility**: HTML implementation must not break or interfere with existing Qt application functionality
- **Performance**: Web server and form generation must be performant enough for single-user or small team usage (not optimized for massive scale initially)
- **Technologies**: Must use C++ for shared core (matching existing codebase). HTML/JavaScript for web interface. Shared code must not require Qt libraries.
- **Browser**: No requirement for IE/legacy browser support; assume modern browsers with ES6 JavaScript support

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for MVP)

- Advanced theming/branding customization for HTML interface
- Multi-user session management and user authentication
- Database persistence of configurations
- Remote schema repository/marketplace integration
- API documentation and SDK for third-party schema developers
- Internationalization/localization support
- Form preview in Qt before deployment
- Configuration versioning and rollback
