## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Critical Path

1. ‚úÖ Phase 1 Setup (must complete first, enables Phase 2)
2. ‚úÖ Phase 2 Foundational (BLOCKS all user stories)
3. üéØ Phase 3 & 4 (can run in parallel once Phase 2 complete)
4. ‚úÖ Phase 5 Shared Core Validation (after 3 & 4, before release)
5. ‚úÖ Phase 6 Polish (final sprint before release)

### Parallelization Opportunities

**Phase 1**: All [P] tasks can run in parallel
- T002-T005 (CMakeLists.txt files) independent
- T010-T017 (directories) independent

**Phase 2**:
- T021-T024 (Core data structures) independent
- T025-T032 (Schema extraction) independent
- T033-T040 (I/O extraction) independent
- T047-T051 (Unit tests) independent
- All can start once corresponding extraction task begins

**Phase 3 & 4**: After Phase 2 complete
- Phase 3 User Story 1 (US1) and Phase 4 User Story 2 (US2) can run in parallel
- Within US2, contract tests (T125-T132) run in parallel with implementation

**Phase 6**: All [P] tasks run in parallel
- Clang-tidy (T175), Coverage (T180), Documentation (T185), Performance (T190), Security (T195) independent

### User Story Testing Sequence

Each user story should be testable independently:

1. **US1 Tests First**: Deploy without Qt, verify server starts, schema list loads
2. **US2 Tests After US1 Stable**: Load schema, generate form, validate, save
3. **US3 Tests Ongoing**: Verify no duplication, both targets work identically

| **SC-006**: 10 concurrent users | T082, T194 | Testable in Phase 6 |
| **SC-007**: Qt-free deployment | T045, T078-T082 | Testable in Phase 3 |
| **SC-008**: 100% core reuse | T162-T163, T157-T160 | Testable in Phase 5 |
| **SC-009**: Upload < 5s (10MB) | T127-T128 | Testable in Phase 4 |
| **SC-010**: Clear deployment docs | T087-T089, T147-T150 | Testable in Phase 6 |

## Risk Mitigation & Contingencies

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Tasks |
|------|------------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Core extraction breaks Qt | High | Critical | Extract incrementally, test Qt after each step | T053-T058 |
| Form generation complexity | Medium | High | Prototype with simple schemas first, expand incrementally | T091-T094 |
| Validation parity issues | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive comparison tests early | T134-T136 |
| Performance with large schemas | Low | Medium | Implement streaming/caching early | T092, T192 |
| Docker deployment issues | Low | Medium | Test Docker build early in Phase 3 | T078-T082 |
| Build system complexity | Medium | Medium | Validate all 3 scenarios frequently | T007-T009 |
