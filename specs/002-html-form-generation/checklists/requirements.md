## Validation Details

### Content Quality Analysis

**No implementation details**: ✅ Confirmed
- Spec uses terms like "local web server", "HTML forms", "schema" without specifying programming languages, frameworks (Qt mentioned only in context of existing vs new), or database technologies
- Success criteria describe user outcomes, not technical implementations (e.g., "under 2 seconds" instead of "use async/await")

**Focused on user value**: ✅ Confirmed
- Primary value proposition clearly stated in User Story 1: Enable non-Qt environments to use ConfigGUI
- Secondary value: Complete configuration management tool via web
- All stories describe user benefits, not system internals

**Written for non-technical stakeholders**: ✅ Confirmed
- Language is business-focused: "developer", "end user", "configuration manager", "DevOps engineer"
- Technical terms are explained in context (e.g., "JSON or YAML schema" not "parser implementation")
- User stories use plain language with clear benefits

**All mandatory sections completed**: ✅ Confirmed
- User Scenarios & Testing: 5 user stories + edge cases ✅
- Requirements: 12 functional requirements + key entities ✅
- Success Criteria: 10 measurable outcomes ✅

### Requirement Completeness Analysis

**No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers**: ✅ Confirmed
- All requirements are specific and actionable
- No ambiguous terms left unresolved
- Assumptions section clarifies design decisions (local server, modern browsers, HTTP vs HTTPS, etc.)

**Requirements are testable and unambiguous**: ✅ Confirmed
- Each FR can be verified through acceptance tests
- Example: FR-001 "provide a local web server" is testable by starting the app and verifying port listening
- Example: FR-003 "generate HTML forms" is testable by comparing Qt and HTML outputs
- Example: FR-007 "share core functions" is testable by verifying code reuse across implementations

**Success criteria are measurable**: ✅ Confirmed
- SC-001: "under 2 seconds" - quantitative
- SC-002: "under 1 second" - quantitative
- SC-003: "under 200ms latency" - quantitative
- SC-004: "95%+ visual parity" - quantitative with clear metric
- SC-006: "at least 10 simultaneous users" - quantitative
- SC-008: "100% of shared core" - quantitative
- SC-009: "under 5 seconds for files up to 10MB" - quantitative with scope

**Success criteria are technology-agnostic**: ✅ Confirmed
- SC-001/002/003/009: Describe user experience ("under X seconds") not implementation details
- SC-004: Describes outcome (visual parity) not technical approach
- SC-006: Describes system capacity not specific database/cache technology
- SC-007: Describes deployment environment (Qt-free) not specific OS or container tech
- SC-010: Describes documentation deliverable not build process details

**All acceptance scenarios defined**: ✅ Confirmed
- User Story 1: 3 acceptance scenarios (system startup, main form display, form generation)
- User Story 2: 4 acceptance scenarios (schema selection, validation, form display, submission)
- User Story 3: 3 acceptance scenarios (shared core reuse, identical validation, no interference)
- User Story 4: 2 acceptance scenarios (export options, file download)
- User Story 5: 2 acceptance scenarios (container startup, feature functionality)
- Total: 14 acceptance scenarios covering all flows

**Edge cases identified**: ✅ Confirmed
- 8 edge cases identified covering error scenarios, size limits, concurrency, and data issues
- Examples: "invalid/malformed schemas", "very large schemas", "connection loss", "concurrent users"
- Examples: "special characters", "upload size limits", "memory constraints", "external dependencies"

**Scope is clearly bounded**: ✅ Confirmed
- MVP scope: Form generation, validation, export, local server
- Explicitly out of scope: Advanced theming, authentication, database, remote repos, i18n, versioning
- Clear architectural boundaries: Qt code isolated from shared core
- Clear deployment boundaries: Qt-free environments supported, HTTPS not initially required

**Dependencies and assumptions identified**: ✅ Confirmed
- Assumptions: 7 clearly stated (refactoring Qt code, HTTP sufficiency, modern browsers, localhost, configurable port, local storage, local export)
- Constraints: 5 identified (architectural separation, compatibility, performance, tech stack, browser support)
- Dependencies: Implicit on existing codebase and JSON/YAML schema standards

### Feature Readiness Analysis

**All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria**: ✅ Confirmed
- Each FR-001 through FR-012 is addressed by corresponding acceptance scenarios
- FR-001 "local web server": Tested by "application launches and listens on localhost"
- FR-003 "generate HTML forms": Tested by "form generated and displayed"
- FR-007 "share core functions": Tested by "100% code reuse with no duplication"

**User scenarios cover primary flows**: ✅ Confirmed
- P1 (Highest priority): Non-Qt deployment, schema-based form generation, shared core architecture (3 critical flows)
- P2 (Secondary): Configuration export, Docker containerization (2 supporting flows)
- All flows cover user journey from deployment through configuration management
- Covers both happy paths and developer/DevOps scenarios

**Feature meets measurable outcomes**: ✅ Confirmed
- User Story 1 achieves SC-007: "deploy in Qt-free environment with all functionality"
- User Story 2 achieves SC-001/002/003/004: "startup time, form generation speed, validation latency, parity with Qt"
- User Story 3 achieves SC-008: "100% shared core reuse"
- User Story 4 achieves SC-005: "export succeeds for large schemas"
- User Story 5 achieves SC-006: "10 concurrent users without degradation"

**No implementation details leak into specification**: ✅ Confirmed
- "C++ core" mentioned only in architectural context (Assumptions/Constraints sections), not in user stories
- "HTML/JavaScript" not detailed in acceptance scenarios
- "WebSockets" explicitly not required
- Qt mentioned only as comparison baseline and architectural isolation point
- No database, API framework, or deployment technology specified

## Notes

All quality checklist items PASS. Specification is complete, testable, and ready for planning phase.

**Key strengths**:
1. Clear architectural vision with shared core reducing duplication
2. Multiple user stories covering different personas (developer, end-user, configuration manager, DevOps)
3. Prioritization enables MVP approach (P1 = 3 stories cover core value)
4. Comprehensive edge cases prevent scope creep during planning
5. Measurable success criteria enable objective verification

**Ready for**: `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan` command
