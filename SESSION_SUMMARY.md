# Session Summary - AutoRules Save Issue Investigation

## Session Goal
Investigate and fix the issue where autoRules array fields (rdf, shapefiles, 3d-landmarks) are being saved as numbers instead of string arrays.

## What Was Done

### 1. Issue Analysis ✓
- Identified that autoRules arrays save as integer counts (2, 3) instead of arrays
- Found pattern: rdf/shapefiles/3d-landmarks save wrong, but default/rootRules save correctly
- Discovered count values match array element counts suggesting data is being truncated

### 2. Code Inspection ✓
- Traced data flow from save (getFormData → collectDataRecursive)
- Traced data flow from load (setFormData → applyDataRecursive → updateFieldValue)
- Examined widget registration, creation, and value collection
- Identified five plausible hypotheses with evidence patterns

### 3. Debug Instrumentation ✓
Added comprehensive logging to:
- `form_generator.cpp`:
  - `collectDataRecursive()` - Full tracing of data collection for each property
  - `getFormData()` - Beginning and end of collection with full result dump
  - `addFieldToFormWithMetadata()` - Field registration with widget type logging

### 4. Documentation Created ✓
1. **DEBUGGING_AUTORUN_SAVE.md** - Complete testing guide
2. **AUTORUN_ANALYSIS.md** - Technical analysis with 5 hypotheses
3. **INVESTIGATION_SUMMARY.md** - High-level summary
4. **QUICK_DEBUG.md** - Quick reference for immediate testing

### 5. Build Status ✓
- Successfully compiled with debug logging
- No errors or warnings
- Ready for testing

## Key Findings

### Observed Bug Pattern
```
"autoRules": {
  "rdf": 3,                              // WRONG - should be array
  "shapefiles": 2,                       // WRONG - should be array
  "3d-landmarks": 2,                     // WRONG - should be array
  "default": ["3DFileCompletenessRule"], // CORRECT
  "rootRules": ["RootStructureRule"]     // CORRECT
}
```

### Critical Observation
The numbers (2, 3) are the EXACT COUNTS of the default array values:
- rdf default count: 7 items (showing as 3?)
- shapefiles default count: 3 items (showing as 2?)
- 3d-landmarks default count: 2 items (showing as 2 ✓)

This strongly suggests:
- Form is initialized with default values
- During save, Array count/size is collected instead of array content
- Or array-to-int implicit conversion happening somewhere

## Five Hypotheses (In Order of Likelihood)

### 1. Fields Not Registered (MOST LIKELY)
- Fields exist but `field_widgets_.contains(q_key)` returns false
- collectDataRecursive skips unregistered fields
- Saved JSON ends up with... something else (possibly cached schema defaults?)

### 2. Wrong Widget Type Stored
- Field registered but stores QSpinBox or wrong type
- QSpinBox::value() or other numeric widget collects count instead of array

### 3. ArrayWidget.getValues() Bug
- ArrayWidget found and called, but returns count instead of array
- Code review suggests unlikely, but possible

### 4. field_widgets_ Map Cleared
- Form cleared between loading and saving
- Map doesn't have fields when collecting

### 5. JSON Serialization Bug
- Arrays collected correctly, but serialized wrong
- After getFormData() returns, something overwrites with numbers

## Next Phase: Testing

User needs to:
1. Run the app with debug output capture
2. Load schema, load config, save config
3. Share debug log output
4. Based on output, identify which hypothesis is correct
5. Implement targeted fix

### Test Command
```bash
./build/ConfigGUI 2>&1 | tee debug.log &
# Then: File→OpenSchema, File→OpenConfig, File→Save
```

## Expected Outcome

Debug output will clearly show:
- Which hypothesis is correct
- Exact line/function where bug occurs  
- Why autoRules fields are handled differently
- Why default/rootRules save correctly

## Current Status
- **Investigation**: ✓ COMPLETE
- **Instrumentation**: ✓ COMPLETE
- **Documentation**: ✓ COMPLETE
- **Build**: ✓ COMPLETE
- **Testing**: ⏳ PENDING (requires user interaction)
- **Fix Implementation**: ⏳ PENDING (awaits test results)

## Files Modified
- `src/ui/form_generator.cpp` - Added debug logging
- `DEBUGGING_AUTORUN_SAVE.md` - NEW
- `AUTORUN_ANALYSIS.md` - NEW
- `INVESTIGATION_SUMMARY.md` - NEW
- `QUICK_DEBUG.md` - NEW

## Commits Made
```
e62a381 Add comprehensive debug logging for autoRules save issue
490035c Add comprehensive analysis of autoRules save issue
850eee3 Add investigation summary
c7b4190 Add quick debug reference guide
```

## Estimated Time to Fix
- Testing phase: 10-15 minutes (user runs app, shares output)
- Analysis of output: 5 minutes
- Fix implementation: 15-30 minutes (depends on root cause)
- Verification: 10 minutes
- **Total remaining: 40-70 minutes** from test completion

## Handoff Notes

Ready for user to proceed with testing phase. Everything is instrumented and documented. Debug output will conclusively identify the issue.

Three documents available for different use cases:
- Use **QUICK_DEBUG.md** for immediate testing
- Use **DEBUGGING_AUTORUN_SAVE.md** for detailed testing
- Use **AUTORUN_ANALYSIS.md** for understanding the investigation

Once debug output is obtained, the exact root cause will be obvious from the logs.
