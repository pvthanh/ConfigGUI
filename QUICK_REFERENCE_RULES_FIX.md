# Quick Reference: Rules Rendering Fix

## What Was Fixed

The `rules` section in `dataTypeValidationRule` wasn't showing any rule items. Now it displays all 27 validation rules as collapsible sections.

## The Three Fixes

### Fix 1: Load from Examples
```cpp
// Schema uses "examples", not "default"
// Now checks both: "default" first, then "examples"
```

### Fix 2: Collapse Rules by Default
```cpp
// Rules now render as collapsed (▶) sections
// Click to expand (▼) and see/edit fields
// Matches the rest of the UI behavior
```

### Fix 3: Proper Signal Connections
```cpp
// Fixed signal names for each widget type:
// QLineEdit::textChanged (not currentTextChanged)
// QComboBox::currentIndexChanged (not textChanged)
// QCheckBox::stateChanged
// QSpinBox::valueChanged
// QDoubleSpinBox::valueChanged
```

## Build Status
✅ SUCCESS - Binary updated at 16:33

## Before → After

**Before:** Rules section completely empty  
**After:** All 27 rules visible as collapsible sections

```
▼ Rules:
▶ Item: type
▶ Item: link id
▶ Item: latitude
... (24 more)
[+] [-]
```

Click any rule to expand and edit its properties!

## Testing
1. Load schema
2. Expand dataTypeValidationRule section
3. Expand rules section
4. See all ~27 rules as collapsed items (▶)
5. Click a rule to expand and see its fields
6. Edit any field and verify changes work
7. Add/remove rules with +/- buttons

**Status:** ✅ READY FOR TESTING
