# ConfigGUI - File Dialog Fix Applied

## Issue Found ❌

The file open dialogs were not working. When you clicked "Open", instead of seeing a file browser dialog, you got a placeholder message box saying "File open dialog would appear here".

## Root Cause

The `onFileOpen()` method in `main_window.cpp` was only showing a `QMessageBox` with placeholder text instead of actually opening a `QFileDialog`.

## Fixes Applied ✅

### 1. **Proper File Dialog Implementation**
   - Replaced placeholder `QMessageBox` with actual `QFileDialog::getOpenFileName()`
   - Added separate methods for schema and configuration loading:
     - `onFileOpenSchema()` - for loading JSON schemas
     - `onFileOpenConfiguration()` - for loading configuration files

### 2. **File Loading Logic**
   - Added `loadSchema()` method to read and display schema files
   - Added `loadConfiguration()` method to read and display configuration files
   - Both methods now show file content preview in a message dialog

### 3. **User Interface Improvements**
   - Updated menu items to be more descriptive:
     - "Load Schema" instead of "Open Configuration"
     - "Load Configuration" as a separate menu item
   - Added status label to show which files are loaded
   - Toolbar buttons now match the new menu structure

### 4. **Better File Dialogs**
   - Schema dialog filters for JSON files: `*.json`
   - Configuration dialog filters for JSON and YAML: `*.json, *.yaml, *.yml`
   - Default directory set to Documents folder
   - Proper error handling if file cannot be opened

## Changes Made

**File: `src/ui/main_window.h`**
- Added `#include <QString>` and `#include <QLabel>`
- Added `status_label_` member variable
- Added new slot methods:
  - `onFileOpenSchema()`
  - `onFileOpenConfiguration()`
- Added private helper methods:
  - `loadSchema()`
  - `loadConfiguration()`

**File: `src/ui/main_window.cpp`**
- Added includes for file dialogs and file info:
  - `#include <QFileDialog>`
  - `#include <QStandardPaths>`
  - `#include <QFile>`
  - `#include <QTextStream>`
  - `#include <QFileInfo>`
- Implemented proper file dialogs with `QFileDialog::getOpenFileName()`
- Added file reading and preview functionality
- Updated menu and toolbar to use new methods

## Testing the Fix

### Step 1: Run the Application
```bash
cd /home/thanhpv/Documents/ProjectDocument/SourceCode/testSpecKit/configGui/build
./ConfigGUI
```

### Step 2: Click "Load Schema" Button/Menu
- A proper file browser dialog will appear
- Navigate to: `resources/schemas/application-schema.json`
- Click "Open"
- A message will show confirming the schema loaded with a preview

### Step 3: Click "Load Configuration" Button/Menu
- Another file browser dialog will appear
- Navigate to: `resources/configs/sample-config.json`
- Click "Open"
- A message will show confirming the configuration loaded with a preview

### Step 4: Try File Navigation
- The dialogs now have proper file filters
- You can navigate through your filesystem
- You can see detailed file information

## Current Features

✅ **File Dialogs Working**
- Schema loading: Filters for JSON files
- Configuration loading: Filters for JSON and YAML files
- Proper file browser with navigation
- File path display and validation

✅ **User Feedback**
- Status bar shows which files are loaded
- Message dialogs confirm successful loading
- File content preview shows first 200 characters
- Error messages if file cannot be opened

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Auto-generate Form from Schema** - Parse loaded schema and create form controls
2. **Populate Form from Config** - Load configuration values into form fields
3. **Real-time Validation** - Validate inputs as user types
4. **Generate Output** - Save edited configuration to new file
5. **Form Display** - Show form controls for editing instead of just message boxes

## Rebuild Instructions

The project has been automatically rebuilt with these fixes:

```bash
cd /home/thanhpv/Documents/ProjectDocument/SourceCode/testSpecKit/configGui/build
./ConfigGUI
```

The new executable is ready to use! All file dialogs should now work properly.
