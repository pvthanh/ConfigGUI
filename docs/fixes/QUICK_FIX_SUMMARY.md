# ✅ Pattern Loading Issue - FIXED

## Issue Description
When loading validation rules from the schema, regex patterns containing special characters (particularly curly braces) were being **truncated** in the GUI.

**Example:**
- Expected pattern: `^\\+?[0-9 \\-/()]{3,}$` (phone number regex)
- What was displayed: `^\\+?[0-9 \\-/()]{3,` (truncated)

## Root Cause
The shorthand format parser was using naive string searching to find opening/closing braces `{}`. When a pattern contained regex quantifiers like `{3,}`, the parser would mistake the first `}` (part of the regex) for the closing brace of the modifiers section.

```
Shorthand string:
  string{required,pattern:^\\+?[0-9 \\-/()]{3,}$}
         ^                                  ^      ^
         |                                  |      |
      Parser finds this first ────────────┘       |
      and thinks it's the end ───────────────────┘
      But it's actually part of the regex!
```

## Solution
**Bypass the shorthand format** by adding a new RuleEditorWidget constructor that accepts a `RuleDefinition` object directly, rather than parsing a shorthand string.

### Files Modified
1. **src/ui/rule_editor_widget.h** - Added new constructor declaration
2. **src/ui/rule_editor_widget.cpp** - Implemented new constructor
3. **src/ui/object_array_widget.cpp** - Use new constructor instead of shorthand conversion

### Code Change Summary
```cpp
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
std::string shorthand = RuleParser::toShorthand(rule_def);
auto* rule_editor = new RuleEditorWidget(rule_name, shorthand, form_widget);

// AFTER (FIXED):
auto* rule_editor = new RuleEditorWidget(rule_name, rule_def, form_widget);
```

## Results
✅ Patterns with special characters now display correctly
✅ No truncation of regex patterns
✅ Phone number validation rule works as expected
✅ All other validation rules unaffected
✅ Fully backward compatible
✅ Clean build with no errors
✅ GUI application running successfully

## Status
- **Commit:** `06801c0` - Fix: Pattern loading with special characters
- **Commit:** `b5d9ac2` - Docs: Comprehensive pattern loading fix report
- **Branch:** master
- **Status:** ✅ MERGED to origin/master
- **Build:** ✅ SUCCESS
- **Testing:** ✅ VERIFIED

## How to Test
1. Run: `./build/ConfigGUI`
2. Load Schema: `resources/schemas/config.schema.json`
3. Load Config: `resources/configs/config.json`
4. Navigate to: configureRules → dataTypeValidationRule → rules
5. Find: "phone number" rule
6. Check: Pattern field should show `^\\+?[0-9 \\-/()]{3,}$` (complete)
