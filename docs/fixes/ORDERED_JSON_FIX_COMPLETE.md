# ✅ CRITICAL FIX: Using ordered_json Everywhere

## The Real Problem
You were absolutely right - the order in the schema and GUI didn't match! The root cause was that **many header files were using `nlohmann::json` instead of `nlohmann::ordered_json`**.

The `nlohmann::json` type does **NOT** preserve property insertion order, while `nlohmann::ordered_json` **DOES**.

## What Was Wrong
Even though `form_generator.cpp` and `collectDataRecursive()` were iterating through properties in correct order, the JSON objects themselves were being created and parsed with the regular `json` type, which doesn't preserve order!

```
Schema file (correct order):  3DFileCompletenessRule, BuildingTableRule, ...
                                           ↓
Parse with nlohmann::json (WRONG - loses order!)
                                           ↓
Form displays in arbitrary order
```

## The Complete Fix
Changed ALL `using json = nlohmann::json` to `using json = nlohmann::ordered_json` in these files:

1. ✅ `src/io/json_reader.h` - Already correct
2. ✅ `src/io/json_writer.h` - Already correct
3. ❌ `src/io/yaml_reader.h` - **FIXED**
4. ❌ `src/io/yaml_writer.h` - **FIXED**
5. ❌ `src/core/schema_loader.h` - **FIXED**
6. ❌ `src/core/schema.h` - **FIXED**
7. ❌ `src/core/configuration_data.h` - **FIXED**
8. ❌ `src/core/schema_validator.h` - **FIXED**
9. ❌ `src/validators/ivalidator.h` - **FIXED**

Also fixed parse calls in:
10. ✅ `src/ui/main_window.cpp` line 206 - Changed to `ordered_json::parse()`
11. ✅ `src/ui/main_window.cpp` line 271 - Changed to `ordered_json::parse()`

## How It Works Now

```
Schema file:  3DFileCompletenessRule, BuildingTableRule, ...
                                           ↓
Parse with nlohmann::ordered_json (CORRECT - preserves order!)
                                           ↓
JSON object internally preserves order
                                           ↓
generateFromSchema() iterates in schema order
                                           ↓
Form displays: 3DFileCompletenessRule first ✅
```

## Why This Matters

The issue was that even though the CODE was iterating in the correct order, the JSON DATA STRUCTURE itself wasn't preserving that order during parsing and iteration.

`nlohmann::ordered_json` uses an internal ordered map instead of a hash map, so when you iterate through properties, they come out in the order they were inserted/defined.

## Build Status
✅ **Clean build - no errors or warnings**

## Next Steps
Test the GUI now - the configureRules section should display in the correct order matching the schema properties definition.
