ISSUES FIXED: 2/2 ✅

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔴 ISSUE #1: Download Endpoint Returns 404

BEFORE:
  ❌ GET /api/config/download/config_test.json → 404 Not Found
  ❌ Console Error: "Download failed at downloadFromServer (main.js:1379:19)"
  ❌ Server Logs: (no handler invoked)

ROOT CAUSE:
  • get_regex() method in http_server.cpp was not registering routes
  • cpp-httplib v0.11 doesn't support dynamic path parameters
  • Route registration incomplete - routes never reached handler

SOLUTION:
  ✅ Added getServer() public accessor to HttpServer class
  ✅ Registered catch-all route: raw_server->Get(R"(/api/config/download/.*)", ...)
  ✅ Implemented path-based filename extraction in handler
  ✅ Applied same fix for DELETE /api/config/{filename}

AFTER:
  ✅ GET /api/config/download/config_test.json → 200 OK
  ✅ File downloads successfully with correct headers
  ✅ Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="config_test.json"
  ✅ Server logs show file transfer: "[FILE] Sending file: /home/.../.configgui/configs/config_test.json"

VERIFICATION:
  $ curl -I http://localhost:8080/api/config/download/config_test.json
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK                                        ✅
  Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="..."       ✅
  Content-Length: 6770                                   ✅
  Content-Type: application/json                         ✅

🟡 ISSUE #2: Unnecessary Export Configuration Button in UI

BEFORE:
  ❌ Export button visible in form header (💾 icon)
  ❌ "Export Configuration" button in form-actions
  ❌ Redundant with "Save Configuration" button
  ❌ User confused by duplicate functionality

ROOT CAUSE:
  • Export button HTML was still present in index.html
  • Button was redundant after implementing hybrid save feature
  • No clear difference between Export and Save

SOLUTION:
  ✅ Removed export button icon from form header
  ✅ Removed "Export Configuration" button from form-actions
  ✅ Verified no JavaScript event listeners for export-btn

AFTER:
  ✅ Clean UI with single "💾 Save Configuration" button
  ✅ No export-btn in DOM
  ✅ No "Export Configuration" text in HTML

VERIFICATION:
  $ grep "export-btn\|Export Configuration" src/html/assets/index.html
  (no output)                                            ✅

ENDPOINTS WORKING

✅ POST   /api/config/save          → Save config (local + server)
✅ GET    /api/config/list          → List all saved configs
✅ GET    /api/config/download/*    → Download specific config [FIXED]
✅ DELETE /api/config/*             → Delete specific config [FIXED]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

BUILD STATUS: ✅ SUCCESS

[100%] Built target ConfigGUIServer
No compilation errors or critical warnings

TESTS PASSED:
  ✅ List endpoint returns file list with correct metadata
  ✅ Download endpoint returns 200 OK with file content
  ✅ Download endpoint sets correct Content-Disposition header
  ✅ Delete endpoint accepts dynamic paths
  ✅ Server logs show correct handler invocation
  ✅ UI renders without export button
  ✅ No JavaScript console errors

NEXT STEPS: Ready for Production Testing

1. Open http://localhost:8080 in browser
2. Load a schema from resources/schemas/
3. Fill out configuration form
4. Click "Save Configuration"
5. Enter custom filename when prompted
6. Verify file saved to local PC (file picker dialog)
7. Verify file backed up to server (~/.configgui/configs/)
8. Click download icon under "Saved Configurations (Server Backup)"
9. Verify file downloads successfully
10. Delete the file to test DELETE endpoint
