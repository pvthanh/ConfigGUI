# Server Save Endpoint - Testing Guide

## ✅ Endpoint Status: WORKING

The `/api/config/save` endpoint is confirmed working:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/config/save \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"filename":"test.json","data":{"key":"value"}}'

Response (HTTP 200):
{
  "success": true,
  "path": "/home/thanhpv/.configgui/configs/test.json",
  "message": "Configuration saved to server backup"
}
```

## Current Issue

Your browser was showing 404 errors, but the endpoint is working. Possible causes:

1. **Browser Cache**: Old cached version of main.js
2. **Server Not Running**: Previous server crashed or wasn't started
3. **Timing Issue**: Server was starting when test was run
4. **Network Issue**: Browser tab pointing to different address

## What Was Fixed

1. ✅ Enhanced server logging to show when handler is called
2. ✅ Enhanced JavaScript logging to show exact request details
3. ✅ Better error messages

## Testing Steps

1. **Hard Refresh Browser** (Ctrl+Shift+Del or Cmd+Shift+Del)
   - Clear ALL cache
   - Close all ConfigGUI tabs
   - Reopen http://localhost:8080

2. **Open Browser DevTools** (F12)
   - Go to Console tab
   - Filter by "SERVER" to see server backup logs

3. **Test Save INI**
   - Load a schema
   - Click "Save Configuration"
   - Select "INI Format"
   - Enter filename
   - Choose local location
   
4. **Look for New Logs**
   ```
   [SERVER] Fetch URL: /api/config/save
   [SERVER] Request Method: POST
   [SERVER] Request Headers: Content-Type: application/json
   [SERVER] Response Status: 200 OK  ← Should see this if working!
   [SERVER] Backup saved successfully: ...
   ```

5. **Server Logs**
   - Open terminal where server is running
   - You should see:
   ```
   [FILE] ============================================
   [FILE] SAVE CONFIG HANDLER CALLED
   [FILE] Received POST /api/config/save
   [FILE] Saved configuration to: /home/thanhpv/.configgui/configs/...
   ```

## Server Directory

Configs are saved to: `/home/thanhpv/.configgui/configs/`

You can verify files are saved there:
```bash
ls -la ~/.configgui/configs/
```

## Current Server Status

- **Process**: Running (PID: 171502)
- **Port**: 8080
- **Host**: 0.0.0.0
- **Endpoint**: POST /api/config/save → HTTP 200 OK
- **Test Result**: ✅ WORKING

## Next Steps

1. Hard refresh browser (clear cache completely)
2. Test again with new logging enabled
3. Share console logs from the "SERVER" section
4. Check if response.Status shows 200

This will help identify if:
- Browser is making the request correctly
- Server is responding as expected
- Response is being processed correctly by JavaScript
