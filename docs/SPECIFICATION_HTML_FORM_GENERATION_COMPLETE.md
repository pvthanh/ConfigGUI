**Date**: October 24, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **SPECIFICATION READY FOR PLANNING**

---

## 📋 Specification Details

**Feature Name**: HTML Form Generation with Local Server  
**Feature Branch**: `002-html-form-generation`  
**Specification File**: `/home/thanhpv/Documents/ProjectDocument/SourceCode/testSpecKit/configGui/specs/002-html-form-generation/spec.md`  
**Checklist File**: `/home/thanhpv/Documents/ProjectDocument/SourceCode/testSpecKit/configGui/specs/002-html-form-generation/checklists/requirements.md`

## ✨ What This Feature Enables

### Core Value Proposition
Enable ConfigGUI to generate HTML-based configuration forms in environments where Qt is not available or desired, while sharing all validation and core logic with the existing Qt application.

### Key Benefits
1. **Reach**: Deploy ConfigGUI to embedded systems, lightweight servers, and Docker containers without Qt dependencies
2. **Flexibility**: Users choose between Qt desktop app or HTML web interface
3. **Maintainability**: Single shared C++ core means bug fixes and features benefit both implementations
4. **Scalability**: Web interface enables cloud deployment and multi-user scenarios

## 📊 Specification Summary

### User Scenarios (5 Total)

| Priority | User Story | Value Proposition |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **P1** | Developer deploys HTML app without Qt | Non-Qt environment support |
| **P1** | End user generates form from schema | Core web UI functionality |
| **P1** | Developer maintains shared codebase | Long-term maintainability |
| **P2** | Manager uses HTML for config export | Configuration management tool |
| **P2** | DevOps containerizes application | Cloud deployment scenario |

**MVP Scope**: All P1 stories (3 core flows delivering complete value)

### Functional Requirements (12 Total)

**Web Infrastructure**:
- FR-001: Local web server with HTML main form
- FR-002: Schema selection/upload capability

**Form Generation**:
- FR-003: Generate HTML forms from JSON/YAML with parity to Qt
- FR-004: Real-time validation feedback
- FR-005: Configuration save/submit

**Architecture**:
- FR-007: Shared core for validation, data handling, utilities
- FR-008: Isolated Qt-specific code

**Robustness**:
- FR-009: Error messages matching Qt behavior
- FR-010: Support nested objects/arrays
- FR-011: Create new and edit existing configurations
- FR-012: Graceful malformed schema handling

**Export**:
- FR-006: JSON/YAML export capability

### Success Criteria (10 Measurable Outcomes)

| Metric | Target | Category |
|--------|--------|----------|
| SC-001 | Startup time < 2 seconds | Performance |
| SC-002 | Form generation < 1 second | Performance |
| SC-003 | Validation feedback < 200ms | Responsiveness |
| SC-004 | 95%+ Qt parity | Compatibility |
| SC-005 | Support 1000 properties | Scale |
| SC-006 | 10 concurrent users | Concurrency |
| SC-007 | Qt-free deployment works | Independence |
| SC-008 | 100% core code reuse | Maintainability |
| SC-009 | File upload < 5s (10MB) | Performance |
| SC-010 | Clear deployment docs | Documentation |

### Key Architecture Decisions

**Separation of Concerns**:
- **CoreModule** (shared): Validation, schemas, configuration data, utilities
- **QtModule** (isolated): Qt-specific widgets, dialogs, styling
- **HtmlModule** (new): Web server, HTML templates, JavaScript

**Technology Stack** (documented in Assumptions):
- Core: C++ (matching existing codebase)
- Web: HTTP local server (no WebSockets initially)
- Browser: Modern browsers with ES6 support
- Deployment: Localhost only (no remote server initially)
