---

## What Developers Need to Know

### Getting Started

1. **Clone repository** and checkout feature branch `001-schema-driven-config-gui`
2. **Read README.md** in specs folder (5-10 min overview)
3. **Review spec.md** (understand what we're building)
4. **Follow quickstart.md** (set up build environment)
5. **Pick assigned task** from tasks.md
6. **Review component contract** (understand interfaces)
7. **Write tests first** (TDD approach)
8. **Implement component** following contract
9. **Verify MISRA compliance** (clang-tidy 0 violations)
10. **Submit pull request** with code review

### Key Principles

- **Schema is source of truth** - no hardcoded UI
- **Test first** - write tests before implementation
- **MISRA C++ - non-negotiable** - 0 violations allowed
- **Real-time validation** - immediate user feedback
- **Result<T,E> everywhere** - no exceptions
- **Qt signal/slot** - standard for UI events

### Critical Dates

- **Week 1-2**: Core infrastructure (P0 blocker)
- **Week 2-4**: UI and validation (critical path)
- **Week 4-5**: Integration testing
- **Week 5-6**: Final testing and UAT
- **Week 6**: Release readiness review

---

## Success Criteria

The project is "Done" when:

- ✅ All 32 tasks completed (or accepted as P2)
- ✅ All unit tests passing (>80% coverage)
- ✅ All integration tests passing
- ✅ Zero MISRA C++ violations
- ✅ Zero memory leaks (Valgrind clean)
- ✅ Performance targets met (form <2s, validation <100ms, save <500ms)
- ✅ User acceptance testing passed
- ✅ Code review approved
- ✅ Documentation complete

## Next Steps

### For Team Lead

1. **Review tasks.md** - understand task breakdown and effort estimates
2. **Assign tasks** - allocate developers to streams
3. **Set up CI/CD** - implement clang-tidy checks, test automation
4. **Create development branch** - use existing feature branch
5. **Hold kickoff meeting** - ensure all developers understand architecture
6. **Schedule standups** - daily progress tracking
7. **Plan reviews** - code review + component integration reviews

### For Developers

1. **Read all documentation** in specs/ folder (~1-2 hours)
2. **Set up development environment** (quickstart.md, ~30 min)
3. **Run existing tests** to verify setup (cmake build + ctest, ~10 min)
4. **Pick your first task** (coordinate with team lead)
5. **Understand your component** (review relevant contract)
6. **Write test skeleton** (before implementation)
7. **Implement component** according to contract
8. **Verify MISRA compliance** (clang-tidy clean)
9. **Submit PR** with tests + implementation

### For QA/Testing Team

1. **Review success criteria** in spec.md
2. **Understand test workflows** in tasks.md
3. **Prepare UAT checklist** (template in tasks.md - INT5)
4. **Set up test schemas** (samples provided in resources/)
5. **Create test cases** from requirements and edge cases
6. **Plan acceptance testing** after Phase 2 completion

## Technical Guarantees

This documentation guarantees:

✅ **Completeness** - All 16 requirements mapped to components  
✅ **Feasibility** - All technologies verified compatible  
✅ **Clarity** - Contracts specify exact component responsibilities  
✅ **Testability** - Success criteria measurable and specific  
✅ **Quality** - MISRA C++ compliance mandatory from start  
✅ **Efficiency** - Task breakdown enables parallel development  
✅ **Maintainability** - Modular architecture with clear contracts  

---

## Known Constraints & Decisions

### Version 1.0 Scope (MVP)

- ✅ JSON + YAML support (clarification Q3 resolved)
- ✅ Draft 7 JSON Schema only (clarification Q1 resolved)
- ✅ Standalone schemas (no $ref support in v1.0, clarification Q2 resolved)
- ✅ Real-time validation
- ✅ GUI form generation
- ✅ File I/O (load/save)

### Deferred to v1.1+

- Schema references ($ref) - simple MVP first
- Advanced schema features - expand later
- Custom field types - plugin mechanism ready
- Schema composition - requires research
- Template configurations - future enhancement
- Undo/redo - nice-to-have, not MVP

### Hard Constraints

- **MISRA C++**: 0 violations, enforced by clang-tidy
- **No exceptions**: Result<T,E> pattern everywhere
- **Smart pointers**: All dynamic memory
- **Qt 6.x**: Not Qt 5.x (outdated)
- **C++17**: Modern language features
- **Cross-platform**: Linux, Windows, macOS
