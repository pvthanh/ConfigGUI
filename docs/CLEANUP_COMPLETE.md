# 📚 Documentation Cleanup Complete - Summary Report

**Date**: October 24, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE AND PUSHED**  
**Commit**: `a61e2e0`

---

## 🎯 Objective
Clean up the project workspace by organizing all 99+ documentation files from the root folder into a well-organized `docs/` folder structure.

## ✅ What Was Done

### Before Reorganization
```
Root folder:
├── 122+ markdown files ❌
├── Source code files
├── Build & resource folders
└── Very confusing! Hard to find anything
```

**Problem**: 
- 122 markdown files cluttering the root directory
- Difficult to navigate and find specific documents
- Hard to understand project structure
- Unprofessional and difficult to maintain

### After Reorganization
```
Root folder:
├── src/                    (Source code)
├── tests/                  (Test files)
├── resources/              (Schemas & configs)
├── build/                  (Build output)
├── CMakeLists.txt         (Build configuration)
├── README.md              (Project overview - in docs now)
└── docs/                  (ALL DOCUMENTATION) ✅
    ├── fixes/             (33 bug fixes)
    ├── reports/           (34 status reports)
    ├── guides/            (12 how-to guides)
    ├── specifications/    (4 design docs)
    ├── sessions/          (16 session notes)
    └── index files        (Reference guides)
```

**Benefit**: Clean, organized, professional structure!
